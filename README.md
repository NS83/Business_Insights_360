# Business_Insights_360

**Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware is an electronics company that manufactures consumer goods and operates in various countries. As the company continues to grow rapidly, Excel alone doesn't seem sufficient to provide comprehensive business insights. While Atliq continued to experience substantial growth, they also incurred a significant loss in Latin America business decisions were made based on a combination of surveys and intuition. One of the top agenda items in the annual strategic meeting was to onboard a data analyst team to enable data-driven decision-making within the company. The product owner of Atliq Hardwares had provided an excel file with report features outlining the requirements of five different dashboards.
