# Business_Insights_360

**Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware is an electronics company that manufactures consumer goods and operates in various countries. As the company continued to grow rapidly, Excel alone wasn't sufficient to provide comprehensive business insights. While Atliq continued to experience substantial growth, they also incurred a significant loss in Latin America as business decisions were made based on a combination of surveys and intuitions. Meanwhile, AtliQ's competitors continued to experience substantial growth, attributed to their large data analyst team with a robust understanding of the market demographics, consumption patterns, and income levels. The company holds an annual strategic meeting and brings up this issues as one of the key agendas for the year. The stakeholders decide to onboard a data analyst team to facilitate data-driven decision-making within the company. The product owner/ main stakeholder of AtliQ Hardwares provided an Excel file  to the Data Analytics Director with the report features outlining the requiremenwits for five different dashboards. The Data Analytics Director subsequently establishes a Data Analyst team, comprising both a senior and junior data analyst, who then engage in communication with the product owner and start off with the project kick-off meeting.

I worked on this project as part of the Codebasics bootcamp (https://codebasics.io/).

**Data Exploration**

There are two SQL dump files that are provided: gdb041 and gdb056. Both the files were unziped using Winzip after which they were imported into mySQL.
Each file consists of dimension tables and Fact tables. Fact tables consist of transactional data and Dimension tables consist of entities that participate in the transaction.
